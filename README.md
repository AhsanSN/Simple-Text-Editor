# Simple Text Editor

This simple to use text editor allows you to read and write text files. Along with it, it contains two features.

One is the read more feature. Suppose you read a file with thousands of lines. When the file is opened using this software, it only shows you the first 24 lines. It then asks you whether you want to read more lines or not. If 'y' is pressed, it displays all the thousand lines.

Second feature is the suggestion feature. It suggest you a correct command if an incorrect command is given.
